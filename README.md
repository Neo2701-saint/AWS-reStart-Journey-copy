# __**Greetings! NEO SELEPE Here:)**__

This is an introduction to who Neo is and what she is capable of, starting with her first journey through technology, moving into Cloud Practitioning.
I went from knowing nothing about cloud computing to being able to use it confidently. I'm excited to share that I've learned how to set up a virtual server in the cloud and configure it to meet specific business needs. I've also gained experience using cloud-based storage services, such as Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage, to store and retrieve data. Additionally, I've learned how to design and deploy scalable and secure applications using cloud-based services like AWS Lambda. These skills have allowed me to develop a range of capabilities that are valuable in the IT industry and I'm eager to apply them in real-world scenarios. 

# __**A learning journey that has taught me about cloud computing.**__


I've built a strong foundation in app and web development, applying modern frameworks and best practices to deliver polished, user-focused solutions. Currently, I've become proficient in Python, utilizing its capabilities to handle data-driven tasks, automate processes, and develop scalable applications. Recognizing the critical role of modern technology ecosystems, I'm actively expanding my expertise into cloud computing. I've learned how to leverage cloud platforms not only to scale data science workflows and access powerful computational resources on demand but also to collaborate seamlessly across distributed environments. Most importantly, I understand the importance of cost optimization, security, and reliability in cloud-based solutions, and I integrate these principles into my work to enhance technical versatility and deliver more efficient, cost-effective, and impactful data science solutions.
